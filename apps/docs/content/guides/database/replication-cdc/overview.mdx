Change Data Capture (CDC) is a technique used to track and capture changes in your database so they can be replicated to other systems. You might need CDC with your Supabase database in several scenarios:

## Real-time data synchronization

If you need to keep multiple systems in sync with your Supabase database, CDC provides a reliable way to capture and propagate changes as they occur. This is useful when:

- Synchronizing data between your production database and analytics platforms
- Maintaining consistency across microservices that use separate databases

## Analytics and reporting

When you need advanced analytics without impacting your production database:

- Offload complex analytical queries to a dedicated system
- Create data warehouses or data lakes for business intelligence
- Generate reports without putting load on your transactional database

## Event-driven architectures

CDC is essential for event-driven systems where:

- You want to trigger downstream processes whenever data changes
- You need to implement event sourcing patterns
- You're building reactive applications that respond to data changes

## Data integration

When integrating Supabase with other services:

- Feeding data to machine learning pipelines
- Populating search engines like Elasticsearch
- Sending data to third-party services that need up-to-date information

## Backup and disaster recovery

CDC can support more robust backup strategies:

- Comply with policies relevant to the industries and countries you operate in
- Minimize data loss with near real-time replication

By capturing changes at the database level, CDC provides a reliable foundation for these use cases with minimal impact on your application's performance.

Whatever reasons you have, the guides in this section are here to help you configure, manage and optimize CDC from Supabase to almost any external system:
